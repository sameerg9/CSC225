# Algorithms and Data Structures: Part I 

## UVic Winter 2017

Basic techniques for design, analysis, implementation of algorithms and data structures. Foundations: Random access machine model, time and space complexity, worst-case analysis, upper and lower bounds. Proof techniques for algorithm correctness. Basic data structures: stacks, queues, linked lists. Sorting: elementary sorting algorithms, mergesort, quicksort, priority queues. Searching: Binary search trees, balanced search trees, hash tables. Graphs: undirected and directed graphs, graph traversals and applications, topological sort. Algorithm design techniques: greedy, backtracking, divide and conquer.
